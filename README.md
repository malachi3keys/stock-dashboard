# Stock Dashboard

This project is a dashboard that displays stock data (finnHub API). You can search for stocks by name or symbol and add it to your own list of tracked stocks. If you no longer want to keep track of a stock, you can delete them too. When a specific stock is selected from your list, a chart is provided with more detail including price over time and general information about the specific company. 

## Future updates
